This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function expecting a string argument is called with an array of strings.  The error arises from a type mismatch between the function's expected parameter type and the actual argument type. The solution involves modifying the function to accept an array or processing the array elements individually before passing them to the function.
